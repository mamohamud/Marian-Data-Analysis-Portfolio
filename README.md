# Marian's Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to Marian's Data Analysis Portfolio! This repository showcases examples of SQL and Python code that I've developed for various solo projects and coursework in data analytics, machine learning, and SQL. Below are some highlighted projects, complete with data visualizations created in Tableau. Feel free to explore and reach out with any feedback or questions.

## Highlighted Projects

### SQL Data Analysis Project
#### Healthcare Data Analysis

**Description:** This project involved analyzing a healthcare dataset using SQL to uncover insights into patient demographics, medical conditions, billing, and hospital stays. Additionally, a dashboard was created using Tableau for visual representation.

**Tools:** SQL, Tableau

**Goals:**
- Understand the distribution of patient ages.
- Analyze gender distribution.
- Examine the frequency of different medical conditions.
- Investigate billing amounts and hospital stay durations.

### Python Data Analysis Project
#### Maternal Pregnancy Risk Factors Analysis

**Description:** This project involved analyzing a dataset related to maternal pregnancy risk factors using Python. Insights were gained into correlations between age, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure, visualized through various plots including box plots, scatter plots, and a heatmap.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Key Insights:**
- Identified correlations between maternal age and blood sugar levels.
- Examined relationships between systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
- Visualized risk level distributions and age-related trends using boxplots and a pie chart.
